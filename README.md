# Predicting-Plant-Traits

A pretrained Resnet50 convolutional model was used to extract 2048 key photographic features of plant photographs, captured through citizen science. Pairing this with 163 ancillary features allowed for a rich feature set, which was then pipelined into a tuned boosting algorithm (XGBoost) to accurately predict target features of unseen images. Ultimately, this resulted in an average RÂ² test score of approximately 0.3 across the six target features, showcasing successful model performance.

To run the prediction pipeline, simply download predict.py and run the file in a terminal or PowerShell window.
Enter 'G', 'B', or 'N' based on the desired tuning method (G for Grid search, B for Bayesian search, or N for no tuning - fastest).
This is the only required input; final predictions will be saved as a .csv file.

See report.pdf for a full breakdown of the project.
